## Conclusion {.page_break_before}

>1. **Fitting a single clock model to the global phylogeny of *Y. pestis* is not statistically supported**. <br> This can be observed in the relative instability of the MCMC analyses on the *reduced*  dataset, which fails to converge in parameter space. <br>
>1. ***Y. pestis* has much more temporal signal than previously thought.**<br>
> Separating the genomic dataset by clade recovers robust temporal signal for the majority of clades.<br>
>1. **The true substitution rates of *Y. pestis* are much higher than previously thought.**<br>
> The mean substitution rate of all global populations (1.59E-8) is a drastic underestimate compared to the rates observed by clade which range from 3.51E-8 to 1.29E-7. The clades without temporal signal are pulling down the mean estimate. Previous work estimated that *Y. pestis* has one of the lowest observed substitution rates, on par with the exceptionally slow-evolving *Mycobacterium leprae* [@duchene2016GenomescaleRatesEvolutionary]. This study instead reports the substitution rate of *Y. pestis* to be much higher, and comparable to *Mycobacterium tuberulcosis*.<br>
>1. **Root-to-tip regression is a poor statistical test of temporal signal compared to BETS**.<br>
> The root-to-tip regression has several known limitations, namely the underlying assumption of strict clock-behavior and the non-independence of data points [@duchene2020BayesianEvaluationTemporal]. A BETS analysis counters these statistical violates, and is overall more sensitive given that multiple clock models can be tested.  In this study, root-to-tip regression indicated temporal signal in 3/12 lineages while the BETS analysis detected signal in 7/12 lineages.<br>
